# home_work_modul06
Home work modul06 youcode.


The application was made as part of homework for youcode.

This app adds a task to the list. It was programmed in javascript and styled in css and html ofcorse.

The task was not easy and at first seemed impossible. After watching the lesson a few times, things became clearer.
